	<!-- Desktop's composer window. Mobile composes on a page of its own — see ComposeView — so
	     nothing here has a mobile form; the openers navigate there instead of mounting this.

	     Modal is the default, and is the Dialog it always was; docked and minimised are the other
	     two states (#407).

	     All three controls live in the header's `title` slot, with the Dialog's own close button
	     turned off. Left on, it sits outside the slot as the other half of a `justify-between`
	     row whose first half is `flex-1` — so it lands flush against ours, and the three read as
	     8px, 8px, nothing. One row, one gap.

	     `show-close-button` is a prop, not an option: Dialog resolves every other key as
	     `props.x ?? options.x` but this one only reads the prop, so in `:options` it is dropped
	     and the built-in close comes back. -->

	<!-- The editor is rendered once and teleported into whichever container is showing, rather
	     than sitting in each one's slot: those are different components, so a state change would
	     remount TipTap and take the draft with it. Moving DOM keeps the instance.

	     `disabled` covers the tick between one container unmounting and the next mounting, when
	     there is no target — the children render in place, and `hidden` keeps that off screen.

	     Held while a target exists, not merely while `show` is true: the Dialog animates out, and
	     dropping the editor the moment it was closed emptied the modal mid-flight — you saw it
	     shrink to its own header on the way out. The target outlives `show` by exactly the length
	     of that transition, then goes with it. -->
