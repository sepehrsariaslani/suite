	<!-- The composer's two non-modal presentations: docked to the bottom-right, and minimised to
	     its own title bar. The modal state is frappe-ui's Dialog, unchanged — see SendMail, which
	     owns the state and moves the editor between the two containers.

	     Deliberately not a Dialog: docking exists so the mail you want to quote stays reachable
	     (#407), and a Dialog is `fixed inset-0` with a backdrop over exactly that. Nothing here
	     traps focus, locks scrolling or answers to Esc — the page behind is simply live.

	     Teleported to body for the reason the thread pane is: the layout's `isolate` paints its
	     subtree as one unit, so a composer opened from inside a thread would lose to the pane,
	     which teleports out itself.

	     surface-elevation-1, not surface-base: that is what the Dialog paints itself and its body
	     with, and the two states are the same window. They match in light mode either way; in dark
	     the base is the page's own colour, so a docked composer sank into the list behind it.

	     right-5, because that is where the app's right edge already is: the reading pane's messages
	     and the list's rows both sit on `sm:px-5`. Any other offset leaves the panel a few pixels
	     off a line that is on screen next to it.

	     The width used to be the toolbar's rather than a choice — it wrapped, so anything narrower
	     than its two groups dropped Discard and Send onto a second line. The toolbar holds one line
	     now and scrolls its buttons instead (see ComposeMailToolbar), so this is a choice again:
	     wide enough for a subject and a line of recipients, and no wider than a mail is read.

	     Folded away there is nothing in it but a title and a Close, so it gives most of that back —
	     enough for a subject to be read, and no more. A bar the width of the composer it is standing
	     in for reads as a window that failed to close rather than one set aside. -->
