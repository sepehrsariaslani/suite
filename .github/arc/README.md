# Suite E2E Actions Runners

This directory deploys repository-scoped Meet and Drive ARC runner scale sets on
the dedicated Suite CI host. Runner pods are ephemeral and use Docker-in-Docker
because the E2E workflows require MariaDB and Redis service containers.

## Security boundary

- Both scale sets are scoped to `frappe/suite` and start at zero. Meet permits
  three 6-CPU jobs; Drive permits two 2-CPU jobs.
- E2E jobs run only for pushes, manual dispatches, and `pull_request_target`
  events whose head repository is `frappe/suite`. The protected base workflow
  enforces that gate before explicitly checking out the internal PR commit.
- The Yarn Classic cache is baked into the runner image. Each runner receives a
  private writable copy-on-write view, so cache misses and dependency changes
  remain pod-local and are discarded with the runner.
- Python, Node, Yarn, and `frappe-bench` are baked into the runner image. Jobs
  still initialize a fresh framework Bench, install the checked-out Suite
  commit, and create a fresh site in their private container layer.
- Runner pods receive no Kubernetes API token and have no inbound network access.
- Egress permits DNS and public SSH/HTTP/HTTPS, but excludes private, loopback,
  carrier-grade NAT, link-local, and multicast IPv4 ranges.
- Kubernetes NetworkPolicy cannot block pod-to-node traffic. Keep no unrelated
  services or credentials on the node and restrict host administration with the
  provider firewall and SSH keys.
- DinD is privileged. Keep this cluster dedicated to CI and do not place
  production credentials or workloads on the host.

## GitHub App

An organization owner must create and install a GitHub App for only the
`frappe/suite` repository. Grant these repository permissions:

- Actions: read-only
- Administration: read and write
- Metadata: read-only

Create the secret directly on the host. Do not commit or paste the private key:

```bash
sudo k3s kubectl create namespace arc-runners --dry-run=client -o yaml \
  | sudo k3s kubectl apply -f -
sudo k3s kubectl create secret generic arc-github-app \
  --namespace arc-runners \
  --from-literal=github_app_id='<app-id>' \
  --from-literal=github_app_installation_id='<installation-id>' \
  --from-file=github_app_private_key='/root/github-app.private-key.pem'
sudo shred -u /root/github-app.private-key.pem
```

## Build the runner image

Run the `Build ARC Runner Image` workflow once from the protected default branch.
It publishes `ghcr.io/frappe/suite-actions-runner:2.336.0`. Set the resulting GHCR
package visibility to public so the cluster can pull it without registry
credentials.

## Install

Install Helm v4 on the host, clone this repository at a reviewed revision, then:

```bash
sudo .github/arc/bootstrap.sh
```

The script installs pinned k3s and ARC releases, applies the network policy, and
installs the `suite-e2e-meet` and `suite-e2e-drive` scale sets. It stops if an
existing k3s installation has the wrong version, is inactive, lacks the required
flags, or if the GitHub App secret is absent.

Verify the listener and trigger one E2E workflow manually:

```bash
sudo KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml kubectl get pods -A
sudo KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml helm list -A
```

## Operations

Drain both scale sets before maintenance:

```bash
sudo KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml helm upgrade suite-e2e-meet \
  --namespace arc-runners \
  --version 0.14.2 \
  --reuse-values --set minRunners=0 --set maxRunners=0 \
  oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set
sudo KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml helm upgrade suite-e2e-drive \
  --namespace arc-runners \
  --version 0.14.2 \
  --reuse-values --set minRunners=0 --set maxRunners=0 \
  oci://ghcr.io/actions/actions-runner-controller-charts/gha-runner-scale-set
```

Restore the runner limits with the bootstrap script. The split reserves two Drive
slots while all three Meet shards run concurrently.

When migrating from the legacy `suite-e2e` scale set, run the bootstrap script
before merging the workflow label changes. After no queued or running job uses
`suite-e2e`, remove the old release:

```bash
sudo KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml helm uninstall suite-e2e \
  --namespace arc-runners
```

The Yarn Classic cache is baked into the runner image at `/var/cache/yarn`.
Python, Node, Yarn, and `frappe-bench` are also baked in. Rebuild the image to
update those tools or the dependency seed. Framework benches, Suite installs,
sites, dependency install trees, and build output remain pod-local and are
discarded with every runner.

After migrating from the host cache, drain the scale set and remove the unused
ConfigMap and cache directory:

```bash
sudo KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml kubectl delete configmap \
  --namespace arc-runners suite-e2e-yarn-config --ignore-not-found
sudo rm -rf /var/cache/suite-e2e/yarn
```
