"""Suite Core lifecycle dispatchers.

Phase 3 consolidation: the seven source apps each defined their own lifecycle
hooks (after_install, after_migrate, after_app_install, extend_bootinfo, ...).
A Frappe app can register only ONE handler per lifecycle hook key, so the
per-app handlers are gathered here and invoked in a deterministic order. Each
former app's function is preserved and called; if any single handler raises,
the error is logged and the remaining handlers still run so one app cannot
block another's setup.

Imports are performed lazily inside each dispatcher so that importing
``suite.hooks`` never eagerly pulls in every module's heavy dependencies.
