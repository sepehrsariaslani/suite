"""Sheet trash lifecycle: soft-delete retention and permanent purge.

`delete_sheet` no longer destroys a Sheet — it flags it `trashed` so the owner
can restore it (see :mod:`suite.sheets.api`). This module owns the two ends that
flag implies:

  * ``hard_delete_sheet`` — the actual cascade that erases a Sheet and its
    versioning tables. Called by the user-facing "delete forever" endpoint and
    by the nightly purge. Kept here (not in the API) so both paths share one
    definition of "gone".

  * ``purge_trashed_sheets`` — the scheduled job that permanently removes
    sheets trashed longer than the retention window.

Retention defaults to 30 days (matching Google Drive / Figma / iCloud), and is
overridable per-site via ``sheets_trash_retention_days`` in site_config. The
floor of 1 day stops a misconfigured ``0`` from turning the trash back into an
instant hard delete.
