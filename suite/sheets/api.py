# The frontend ships a Yjs document for CRDT-safe multiplayer editing.
# These endpoints are pure relays: the server validates permission and
# republishes the (already-base64-encoded) Y.Doc updates to every client
# subscribed to the sheet's room. The server never decodes the binary
# updates — it only sees opaque base64 blobs.
#
# Three events sit on the same channel:
#   yjs_update          — incremental doc update
#   yjs_state_request   — a newly-joined peer asks for the current state
#   yjs_state           — another peer's reply carrying a full state dump
# Plus two awareness events for presence/cursors:
#   yjs_awareness       — volatile per-client state (cursor, selection, user)
#   yjs_awareness_bye   — peer is leaving, drop them from presence
