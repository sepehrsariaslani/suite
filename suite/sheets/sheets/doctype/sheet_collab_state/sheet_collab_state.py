"""Sheet Collab State — persisted Y.Doc binary for live multiplayer editing.

One row per Sheet (autoname = `field:sheet`, so the row's `name` *is* the
sheet's name — makes upserts a single keyed lookup). The blob is opaque
base64; only the collab server (Hocuspocus) decodes it. Frappe never
interprets the bytes.

Read and written exclusively by the internal collab endpoints in
`suite.sheets.api` — Desk access is reserved for System Managers so an
operator can inspect / wipe stuck rows during incidents.
