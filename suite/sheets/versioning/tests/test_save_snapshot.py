"""Tests for inline snapshot creation from `save_sheet`.

The legacy flow enqueued `maybe_snapshot` on the worker; if the worker
wasn't running the user saw an empty Version History panel. The Google
Sheets-style behaviour we now ship is:

  * snapshot inline so version history is always present,
  * but swallow snapshot errors so a transient snapshot failure never
    fails the save itself (data loss is the worst sin in this code path).

Both invariants are pinned here so a future refactor can't silently
regress.
