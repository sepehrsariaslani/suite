    """Regenerate the automation Sieve script for accounts whose stored copy may be wrong.

    Two generation bugs are fixed alongside this patch, and both leave incorrect content sitting on
    the Stalwart server:

    - Rule text (``emails_from`` / ``subject_contains``) was interpolated into the script without
      escaping. A value carrying a double quote produced a script the server rejected, so the
      ``SieveScript/set`` failed, the error was swallowed, and the account kept its previous script —
      the user's rule silently never took effect.
    - Mailbox paths were resolved by walking parents by name. Where two mailboxes share a leaf name
      that resolved the wrong parent, so ``fileinto`` was generated against the wrong folder.

    Nothing rebuilds these scripts on a schedule — ``build_automation_sieve`` only runs when a user
    touches a folder, a rule, or screening — so an affected account would keep the bad script
    indefinitely. Rebuilding is idempotent, so a re-run is a no-op for accounts already correct.

    Deferred to a background job: regeneration needs a live JMAP session per account, which is not
    reliably reachable during ``bench migrate``.
